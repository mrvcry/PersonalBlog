Nutrition and important minerals for preventing leg cramps:


**Eating Balanced Diet:** You should be eating a variety of healthy foods during pregnancy to make sure you and your little one are getting enough vitamins and minerals. The minerals that are associated with leg cramps include magnesium, calcium, potassium and iron. My doctor prescribed me magnesium supplements since they are proven to help pregnancy related muscle and tension pains and it helps. However, make sure to talk to your own health care provider before taking any over-the-counter supplements. 

See Table below for important minerals, DRIs and main food sources.

**Important considerations:**

-Check the label to see the %Daily Value of one serving to determine how much the product contributes to your daily recommended intake.

-If you are vegan, make sure to buy calcium fortified plant-based milk, cheese and yogurt and tofu made with calcium sulfate.

-Some ethnic groups may eat less or more from different food groups. For instance; Asian people are most likely to consume a low-calcium diet. In this case, sardines can be a great option to meet your calcium needs. Make sure to discuss your ethnic background and eating habits with your dietitian for an individualized meal plan that meets your daily needs.
