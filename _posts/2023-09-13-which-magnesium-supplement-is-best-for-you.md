The best magnesium supplement for you will depend on your individual needs and preferences. 

Here are some of the most popular and effective magnesium supplements:

**1. Magnesium glycinate:** This is a highly bioavailable form of magnesium that is well-tolerated by most people. It is a good choice for sleep, anxiety, and muscle cramps.


**2. Magnesium citrate:**This is another highly bioavailable form of magnesium that is also gentle on the stomach. It is a good choice for constipation.


**3.** **Magnesium malate:** This form of magnesium is thought to be especially helpful for energy production and muscle function.


**4. Magnesium chloride:** This form of magnesium is dissolved in water, making it a good choice for people who have trouble swallowing pills.

If you are pregnant or planning to have a baby soon, I have additional note for you. Research shows that taking 100 mg magnesium supplement during pregnancy suggested to decrease the following risks: intrauterine growth retardation, preterm labor, maternal body mass index, neonatal weight, pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, cramps of the leg. 

_Prenatals generally do not contain magnesium, so you may need to take them additionally to prevent any of the risks below throughout this journey. I personally use this one since it is in magnesium citrate form.
Hope you find this helpful!_

> If you are unsure which magnesium supplement is right for you, talk to your doctor or a registered dietitian. They can help you choose a supplement that is right for your individual needs.

**Here are some additional tips for choosing a magnesium supplement:**
-Look for a supplement that is third-party tested to ensure that it contains the amount of magnesium advertised.
-Choose a supplement that is made with natural ingredients and does not contain any artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives.
-Start with a low dose and increase the dose gradually until you find the amount that works best for you.
-Take magnesium supplements with food to prevent stomach upset.
