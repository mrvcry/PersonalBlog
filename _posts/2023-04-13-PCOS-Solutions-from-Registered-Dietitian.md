##  What is PCOS?

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome is characterized by irregular menstruation, abnormal hormone levels(high levels of testosterone), hirsutism(overgrowth of hair in the body parts) and increased number of follicle count. Unfortunately, women with PCOS are more likely to develop insulin resistance and diabetes as well. Here are some suggestions to overcome PCOS symptoms:


## Exercising

It does not have to be crazy. Do vinyasa yoga, stretching or explore your options for example try barre (my fave exercise for a year now). Start small such as 30 min/day, if you haven’t been exercising regularly to avoid burnout.


## Breakfast

Skipping breakfast is not a great idea if you have PCOS. Research shows eating big and balanced breakfast can prevent insulin spikes in people with PCOS throughout the day. The key is to keep sugar in certain levels by eating regularly.

Researches recommend breakfasts to consist of at least 20 grams of HBV protein, 30-45 grams of complex carbohydrate, and healthy oils such as chia seeds, avocado, walnuts.

Example;
1- 1 cups of 2% Greek yogurt, 3 tbsp home-made granola, 1 tsp chia seeds, ½ cup berries.
2- 2 poached or scrambled eggs, 2 slice of Ezenkiel or wholewheat sourdough bread and ⅓ medium avocado.

## Vitamins

PCOS is hormonal disorder and thereare vitamins which play important role in our body. Here is the list of vitamins to worth checking and supplementing if needed: Vitamin D, inositol, magnesium.

## Weight Management

Weigth loss can be suggested if needed. Losing weight may help by improving insulin sensitivity and hormone balance. However, it should be individualed decision depending on lifestyle history and eating behavior of patients. Working as a team which includes gynochologist, endocrinologist, dietitian is crucial to address all the concerns and overcome the symptoms.

Be healthy and shine!
