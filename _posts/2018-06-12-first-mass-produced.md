Let’s start with defining the term “dietitian” aka “nutritionist” or “Registered Dietitian Nutritionist(RDN)” who completed 4 years of undergrad school and required coursework plus 1200 hours of supervised practice and finally passed the board exam and became a RDN. You may also want to pursue a Master's Degree as I did twice to be even more qualified in the field.

Therefore,  I think one of the good reasons is to be aware of the fact that no one is as educated as dietitians among health care professions when it comes to nutrition. And yes every dietitian can call themselves a nutritionist, however, nutritionists are not necessarily trained as dietitians they can claim that title over an hour of nutrition class. 

Shortly, RDN is a healthcare professional who helps people to deal with literally anything related to nutrition such as nutrition-related chronic diseases, exercise nutrition, prenatal nutrition, postnatal nutrition, allergy nutrition, kids nutrition or to just to be the best of themselves by feeling better & eating healthy and much more. 

There are many types of services offered from dietitians such as group coaching, self-pace nutrition programs, meal planning and my favorite 1:1 nutrition counseling. First of all, I have +7 years of experience in the field in which I worked in a variety of settings as a dietitian and nutrition counseling has been my passion over the years. I believe nutrition counseling must be extremely individualized and tailored to the client's needs and current lifestyle to be as sustainable as possible. Because I want my client to learn, experience and feel the power of eating for a lifetime not for an x amount of time. To do this, I need to know my clients by all means. What cuisine have you been raised into? What are your stable foods?  What diet have you been following? Where do you go for  grocery shopping? When do you wake up? What food do you like/dislike? Any medical diagnosis/family history? Trust me I have more of these but you got the point! 

Why I am asking all these questions is because the whole picture is important for the outcomes that are expected by the client. However without  1:1 nutrition counseling sessions it does not seem possible if you are seeking for personal/individualized guidance to reach out your goals and live a happy life. 

Nutrition may seem to be a complicated term until you work   with the right dietitian for you. When I say right, I don’t mean that a person could be right or wrong personally but as a teammate in your journey.
