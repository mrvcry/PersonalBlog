While not all herbal teas are safe during pregnancy, there are several you can enjoy with peace of mind. Here are some of the most recommended options:


1- Ginger Tea: Ginger is a natural remedy for nausea and morning sickness which are common pregnancy discomforts. Ginger tea is safe to consume in moderation throughout pregnancy, but limit yourself to around 1-2 cups per day. 


2- Peppermint or Spearmint Tea: Peppermint tea can help soothe nausea and indigestion. If you are experiencing GERD or heartburn, peppermint in general can alleviate your symptoms so do not consume in any type.  

Other herbal teas that considered safe:

🍋 Lemon: literally can be added to any tea ease the nausea and provides Vitamin C

🌼Chamomile: good for insomnia

🍃Fennel: good for digestion

☘️Thyme: good for sore throat

🌾Rooibos (Vanilla flavored from @harneytea was my fave for cold winter nights)


**💭There are teas that recommended to induce labor so make sure to talk to your healthcare provider before drinking these following:**

🔸Red Raspberry Leaf Tea

🔸Lemon balm Tea(aka melissa tea)


_Importants Notes:_

🔔Like most of the foods, moderation is key, with around 1-2 cups of herbal tea is considered safe. 

🔔Make sure to buy from reliable brands and try to go with organic ingredients

🔔Also always check the label for different ingredients and make sure to limit 2 cups a day even if it is a safe choice
