I was one of the last person to try this viral recipe and I regret that I did not try it earlier. Baking the oatmeal in one dish was a great idea! Also this recipe is super easy, healthy, mess-free and most importantly yum! You can cook this as a part of your meal-plan and keep in the refrigirater for up to 4 days!


**BAKED OATMEAL**

Serves: 9 

Ingredients
 
- 2 small or 1 large ripe bananas
- 1 cup gluten-free rolled oats 
- 1 tablespoon chia seeds 
- 1 cups of choice of milk (I used lactaid)
- 1 cup fresh or frozen mixed berries (I used fresh berries)
- 2 tbsp 100% peanut butter or any nut butter
- Â½ teaspoon cinnamon
- Cooking Spray (I used Avacodo oil)

Equipment:
Ceramic or pyrex dish (square; 8x8 inch or rectangle; 8x11 inch both works!)
One Fork

-  1- Preheat the oven to 350F.
-  2- Spray the baking pan.
-  3- Mash the bananas in baking pan with a fork. 
-  4- Add the oats on top, then chia seeds and cinnamon.
-  5- Pour the milk and add the peanut butter.
-  6- Mix with a fork.
-  7- Finally add the berries on top and bake for 25 minutes or until the middle is almost set.



PS: If you like it crispy you can bake until the oats turn golden brown or for 30-35 minutes.
