## Here are some calcium-rich vegan foods you can incorporate into your diet:

**Fortified Plant Milks:** Many plant-based milk alternatives are fortified with calcium. Choose from varieties like soy milk, almond milk, oat milk, and rice milk enriched with calcium. Check the label to ensure it provides at least 30% of your daily calcium needs per serving.


**Tofu:** This versatile soy product is a good source of protein and calcium, containing about 400mg per 3.5-ounce serving of firm tofu. Enjoy it in stir-fries, scrambles, or baked dishes. 

**Calcium-Set Tofu:** A special type of tofu coagulated with calcium chloride, calcium-set tofu is particularly higher in calcium content than regular tofu. Look for it in the refrigerated section of Asian grocery stores.


**Leafy Green Vegetables:** Dark leafy greens like kale, collard greens, mustard greens, and bok choy are loaded with various nutrients, including calcium. While the amount of calcium absorbed from vegetables is less than from dairy products, consuming them regularly contributes to your daily calcium intake.


**Beans and Lentils:** Most beans and lentils are good sources of plant-based protein and fiber, and many also contain a decent amount of calcium. For example, a cup of cooked white beans provides about 13% of the RDI for calcium. 


**Chia Seeds:** These tiny but mighty seeds are powerhouses of nutrition, including calcium, fiber, and omega-3 fatty acids. Enjoy them sprinkled on oatmeal, yogurt alternatives, or added to smoothies. 


**Almonds:** Almonds are a heart-healthy nut that is a good source of calcium, protein, and healthy fats. Enjoy a small handful as a snack, or incorporate them into salads or yogurt alternatives.


**Fortified Cereals:** Many breakfast cereals are fortified with calcium. Choose whole-grain cereals with at least 25% of the DV for calcium per serving.


**Fortified Orange Juice:** Some orange juices are fortified with calcium. Check the label to see if it's a good source of calcium.


By incorporating these calcium-rich vegan foods into your diet, you can help ensure you're meeting your daily calcium needs and keeping your bones strong.

Stay healthy and shine with your baby!
