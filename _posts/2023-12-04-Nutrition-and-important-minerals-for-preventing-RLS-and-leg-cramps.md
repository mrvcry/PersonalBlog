Leg cramps and restless leg syndrome are different in terms of diagnosis, however, the same minerals play an important role to prevent both conditions.

## Checking in your vitamins:

Checking in your Vitamins/Minerals: Leg cramps and restless leg syndrome are different in terms of diagnosis, however, the same minerals play an important role to prevent both conditions and these are **magnesium, calcium, potassium and iron**. RLS, specifically, is associated with **Vit D deficiency**. In this case, you definitely need a supplement because it is hard to be sufficient with food sources. Make sure to share your discomfort with your doctors to get a blood work done for your upcoming visit. You might need a supplement depending on your level of deficiency.

## **Important considerations:**

-Check the label to see the %Daily Value of one serving to determine how much the product contributes to your daily recommended intake.

-If you are vegan, make sure to buy calcium fortified plant-based milk, cheese and yogurt and tofu made with calcium sulfate.

-Some ethnic groups may eat less or more from different food groups. For instance; Asian people are most likely to consume a low-calcium diet. In this case, sardines can be a great option to meet your calcium needs. Make sure to discuss your ethnic background and eating habits with your dietitian for an individualized meal plan that meets your daily needs.
