Intermittent fasting is an eating pattern that has been followed by celebrities, influencers and the wellness world for almost a decade. I will break down the IF to give you a brief explanation from the point of a dietitian. 

What is intermittent fasting?

There are many versions of intermittent fasting(IF). However, there are three main types.
1- Alternate day fasting; alternating the days in fasting and non-fasting days. There are only non-caloric beverages allowed on fasting days while you can eat and drink whatever you want on non-fasting days.
2- Whole day fasting 5:2; eating normally for 5 days in a week and fasting or consuming very little calories for 1 to 2 days; 
3- Time-restricted fasting (16:8) is known as the most popular. You or your dietitian create an eating window which works best with your schedule and you don’t consume anything with calories besides this window. 

Is Intermittent fasting helping you to lose weight/burn fat?
Some researchers concluded that IF can be beneficial to lose weight. Contrary to these findings, some researchers thought that IF is no superior to calorie-deficit diets. There is more research needed on this subject. 

Is it another fad diet?
Not really. IF differs from fad diets by being a lifestyle instead of a list of a bunch of food you should avoid or you should consume. IF is only about the timing of the eating/fasting however a healthy meal plan along with this pattern is always encouraged by health care professionals. 

What is my opinion on practicing IF as a dietitian?
I have been fasting since my childhood during Ramadan. I like to fast because I sometimes lose the physical cues of my body. It makes me happy to catch the cues and feed my soul and body while breaking my fast. I also had clients who have been practicing time-restricted IF. We were working as a team to meet my client’s needs during the eating window to avoid possible deficiencies while losing weight. 


Who needs to avoid IF?
People who have history or active disordered eating and older adults. People with diabetes or anyone who has ongoing disease and taking medicine should consult their health care provider before changing their routine. 


> Benefits of IF are suggested by some researches as controlling blood sugar, weight loss and longevity. It is good to be aware of that these researches studied IF mostly on rats rather than on human subjects. Therefore, the results may differ in human subjects. 

Bottom line: IF is not a miracle. Because you can have the same result as if you follow the low-calorie diet. If it aligns with your schedule do along with healthy meal plan and get the results and see from your  experience instead of someone else’s. Consider consulting a dietitian if you need help to what to eat during your eating window to avoid any deficiencies.
