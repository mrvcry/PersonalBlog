Do you feel nauseaus or vomiting all the time since you learned that you are pregnant? Give these 10 Dietitian Suggestions a try to feel better:

1. Eat small, frequent meals and snacks with protein.

2. Avoid drinking liquid with meals. You may even want to avoid drinking water right before and after meals.

3. Avoid high fat and fried foods all the time unless you are craving and your stomach will be okay with that!

4. Keep dry carbohydrate rich food by your bed and eat as soon as you wake up even before going to the restroom :)

5. Sour foods such as lemon may help with feeling nauseous. Try drinking lemon tea or lemon water. Or squeezing lemon to any food likely to help you!

6. Eat a higher amount of protein in every meal including snacks.

7. Avoid spicy food that may increase your symptoms

8. Ginger supplement (250 mg 2-4 times a day) proven to be helpful in reducing nausea during the first trimester.

9. Another natural remedy would be mint tea but again do not drink with food.

10. Taking prenatal 3 months advance before conception can also help with morning sickness.

Hope this helps you all to have a less painful or none pain at all first trimester!

If not, I highly recommend to see your healthcare provider. Remember you need to eat healthy, nutritious and yummy food not only for you but also for precious your little one! Do not hesitate to reach out by scheduling discovery call with me to learn how I can assist you in this journey!
