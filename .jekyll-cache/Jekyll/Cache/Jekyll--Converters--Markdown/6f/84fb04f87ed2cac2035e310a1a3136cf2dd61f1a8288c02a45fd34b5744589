<p>Hi there! I am a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist Merve. I have Bachelor's and two Master's degrees in Nutrition and Dietetics from Istanbul and New York. Before moving to New York,  I worked at a clinical setting in Istanbul as a Clinical Dietitian; I provided nutrition education, counseling and individuzlied meal plans for more than 300 patients annually. 
Additionally, I worked with companies to provide preventive nutrition care to improve quality of life of white-collered employees. I provided nutrition workshops, seminars and 1:1 coaching as a corporate dietitian.

I always love what I do and how I touch the life of people who I work with. I love sharing the happiness and joy of changes and results of my clients. Therefore, I decided to pursue my education to get my credentials to work as a Registered Dietitian in the US. Of course, it was not easy to go back to school while just starting to live in a different country as a newly married woman who already been a dietitian. I have been through blood, sweat, and tears involved in getting my credentials but I am so glad I did it. Here is my story, I am looking forward to meet you and listen yours!
