I"m<p>##Mindfull Eating Practices</p>

<p>Well..I feel like most of us do and it is not something we know how to not restrict. Hopefully, this post will help you to figure out 🤞🏻❤️
Please answer following questions and do not worry about your answers, we’ll get there 😉</p>

<p>1.Do you ==“ENJOY”== while eating your favorite food?
2.Do you feel guilty after you eat them?
3.Do you avoid buying those items to not to binge?</p>

<p>If your answers are mostly “YES”. Yes
Try these;
1️⃣Take your time! Smell the food, take first bite and enjoy as much as you can. This is my favorite tip🔝even though I sometimes have to remind myself to eat mindfully but it is ok as soon as I know how to do that.
2️⃣Please, do not compensate after you eat your favorite food! Don’t overexercise, do not eat less just because you think that you cheated on your diet UNLESS you feel full and do not feel like eating 🍽
3️⃣You are the one and only person who get to chose what you eat! I know it is tricky to not to eat when you know your favorite dessert in the fridge. BUT..If you know that you can always eat that dessert, would you still binge it? If the answer is YES, follow the first two suggestions and eat the dessert🍽</p>

<p>The quick brown jumped over the lazy.</p>

<p>Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you’re never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here’s a standard YouTube embed code as an example:</p>
