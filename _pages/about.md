I always love what I do and how I touch the life of people who I work with. I love sharing the happiness and joy of changes and results of my clients. Therefore, I decided to pursue my education to get my credentials to work as a Registered Dietitian in the US. Of course, it was not easy to go back to school while just starting to live in a different country as a newly married woman who already been a dietitian. I have been through blood, sweat, and tears involved in getting my credentials but I am so glad I did it. Here is my story, I am looking forward to meet you and listen yours!
